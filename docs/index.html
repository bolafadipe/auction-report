                The auction results reveal a strong performance, with 43.3% of the lots selling within their estimated price range, reflecting accurate pricing strategies by the auction houses. 
                In addition, 40.7% of the lots sold above their estimates, suggesting strong demand and competitive bidding. Only 16% of the lots were sold below their estimate, reflecting a relatively small number of underperforming lots. 
                Importantly, none of the lots went unsold, which signals a very successful auction with high buyer interest.<br><br>

                Phillips outperformed Christie's, accounting for 69% of the total sales with $5.86 million, while Christie's contributed 31%, or $2.64 million. 
                This disparity in sales volume could suggest that Phillips either offered higher-value lots or attracted more competitive bidding. Both auction houses handled a large number of lots but Phillips clearly led in 
                total revenue generated.<br><br>

                Phillips sold 207 lots compared to Christie's 174 lots, further reinforcing its lead in the auction. Despite the difference in lots handled and total sales, both auction houses achieved perfect sell-through rates, 
                showing that every lot found a buyer. This highlights the strong interest in luxury watches from collectors and enthusiasts during the auction.
                The high percentage of lots sold above their estimates suggests that certain items were highly sought after, likely due to their rarity or desirability. 
                This competitive bidding atmosphere was a boon for sellers, as many were able to exceed their price expectations, demonstrating a favorable market environment.<br><br>

                Overall, Phillips dominated the auction in terms of total sales and lots offered, while both auction houses achieved impressive results with all lots sold. 
                A large portion of the lots met or exceeded their price estimates, indicating a robust and competitive luxury watch market that continues to attract buyers.

                    <strong>Phillips led the September 2024 watch auctions with 207 lots sold</strong>, while Christie's sold 174. 
                    Both auction houses achieved a perfect 100% sale rate, with no unsold lots, indicating strong buyer interest and a successful auction event for both.<br><br>

                    Phillips had significantly more lots selling within the estimated range, with 104 lots compared to Christie's 61. This suggests that Phillips' pricing estimates were more aligned with market expectations, 
                    allowing a larger portion of their lots to meet the pre-sale estimates. Christie's, on the other hand, had fewer lots sold within the estimated range, indicating a greater variability in final sales prices 
                    relative to expectations.<br><br>

                    When looking at lots sold below the estimate, Christie's had more challenges, with 46 lots selling below the estimate, compared to only 15 for Phillips. This shows that Phillips performed better in 
                    maintaining higher selling prices relative to the estimates, while Christie's faced some underperformance on a larger portion of their lots.<br><br>

                    Overall, Phillips outperformed Christie's in terms of achieving higher accuracy in pricing and fewer below-estimate sales. Both auction houses enjoyed a high level of demand, as reflected by their perfect sale rates, 
                    but Phillips demonstrated stronger control over pricing, leading to more lots sold within or above the estimate.

                The results of the auction reveal the clear dominance of Patek Philippe and Rolex, which together account for a significant portion of total sales. 
                <strong>Patek Philippe led the auction with $2,298,463.9 million in sales</strong>, solidifying its position as the top brand. Rolex followed closely, achieving around $1.5 million. 
                These two brands continue to be the most recognized and sought-after by collectors, reflecting their ongoing influence and desirability in the luxury watch market. <br><br>

                Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, and Cartier performed well, though at a lower level than the top two, with sales ranging from $0.6 to $1 million. These brands demonstrate strong demand, 
                particularly for iconic models like Audemars Piguet's Royal Oak and F.P. Journe's artisanal offerings, which cater to collectors looking for high craftsmanship and exclusivity. Cartier remains a favorite for its 
                timeless designs and heritage, maintaining steady interest from buyers. <br><br>

                Brands like Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin, Roger Dubuis, and Piaget contributed more modest sales, with totals between $0.2 million and $0.4 million. While these brands are well-regarded, 
                their performance in this auction suggests either fewer pieces on offer or less competitive bidding compared to the leading brands.

                    In summary, the top 5 models performance reveals interesting patterns in the luxury watch market. The Patek Philippe Nautilus leads in total sales at $647,319, 
                    despite having fewer lots sold (5) compared to the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona (6). This indicates the Nautilus commands a significantly higher average price per lot. 
                    Notably, all models achieved a perfect 100% sale rate, suggesting strong demand across these high-end pieces. 
                    The Audemars Piguet Royal Oak variants (Perpetual Calendar Black Ceramic and Openworked Perpetual Calendar) show impressive individual lot values, each selling just one piece but ranking 4th and 5th in total sales respectively.
                    The Aquanaut, another Patek Philippe model, performs strongly in the middle of the pack. Interestingly, most models saw their lots sell either above or within estimates, 
                    with only the Daytona and Aquanaut having an even split between above and within estimate sales. This overall trend of meeting or exceeding estimates across these top models indicates a robust and confident market for premium watches, 
                    with Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet models particularly standing out in terms of value per lot.

            <p>
                <strong>The 40mm case size emerged as the clear leader in total sales, contributing approximately $2 million.</strong> This size's popularity reflects its broad appeal, offering a perfect balance between classic proportions and modern versatility. 
                Collectors appreciate the 40mm case for its ability to suit various styles, from sport to dress watches, making it a go-to size for both traditional and contemporary designs.<br><br>

                The 42mm case size followed closely, with sales nearing $1 million. This size indicates growing interest in larger, more assertive watches, especially in the luxury sports watch category. 
                Larger cases are often favored for their bold wrist presence and modern aesthetics, appealing to collectors seeking statement pieces that stand out.<br><br>

                Mid-range sizes, including 36mm, 39mm, and 41mm, also performed well, underscoring the continued demand for smaller, more refined watches. These sizes, often associated with vintage or understated designs, 
                appeal to collectors who prioritize elegance and timelessness over boldness. Their strong performance indicates that there is still a significant market for watches that balance tradition and modern functionality.<br><br>

                In summary, the results show that while there is demand across a range of case sizes, the most popular sizes fall within the 40mm to 42mm range, reflecting a strong preference for versatility and bold yet wearable designs. 
                Smaller and larger case sizes saw less activity, suggesting that while they cater to specific tastes, most collectors favor more moderately sized watches. The auction results emphasize that mid-sized watches remain dominant in the luxury market, balancing both modern trends and classic appeal.

                Stainless steel stands out as the most popular case material in the auction, generating the highest total sales, just above $2 million. This reflects the strong demand for stainless steel watches, 
                which are favored for their versatility, durability, and more accessible price point compared to precious metals. Stainless steel is widely used in both sports and dress watches, 
                contributing to its broad appeal among collectors.<br><br>

                Following stainless steel, both 18K pink gold and 18K white gold performed well, each contributing significantly to total sales. These materials are prized for their luxury appeal, 
                adding both aesthetic value and exclusivity to the timepieces. Gold, in its various forms, remains a symbol of wealth and prestige, and its continued presence among the top materials reflects the preferences of buyers 
                seeking higher-end luxury watches.<br><br>

                Platinum also made a strong showing in the auction, reflecting its premium status in the luxury market. Known for its rarity, weight, and durability, platinum watches often command higher prices, appealing to collectors 
                looking for the most exclusive timepieces. Other gold variants, such as 18K yellow gold and 18K pink gold with diamonds, also contributed to sales, but on a smaller scale compared to stainless steel and other gold types.<br><br>

                In conclusion, stainless steel led the auction by a significant margin, reflecting its widespread appeal. Gold and platinum also showed strong performance, highlighting the ongoing demand for precious metals in luxury watches. 
                The mix of materials suggests that collectors appreciate both the affordability and versatility of stainless steel, as well as the prestige and exclusivity that comes with gold and platinum watches. Overall, 
                the results indicate a balanced market catering to a range of tastes and budgets.

                   <strong> Leather bracelets generated the highest total sales, reaching over $1.6 million.</strong> This highlights the popularity of leather, a classic material in luxury watches known for its comfort, versatility, and timeless elegance. 
                Leather straps are often paired with both vintage and modern watches, making them a favorite choice among collectors.<br><br>

                Crocodile bracelets followed closely, bringing in significant sales just under $1.4 million. Crocodile leather is highly prized for its exotic and luxurious appearance, appealing to buyers looking for premium materials. 
                Its popularity in high-end watches reflects its association with exclusivity and craftsmanship.<br><br>

                Other materials such as the stainless steel Rolex Oyster bracelet and various gold and ceramic bracelets from brands like Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet contributed more modestly to total sales. 
                These materials cater to buyers seeking durable and visually distinctive options, particularly for sports watches or models that emphasize unique design elements.<br><br>

                In summary, leather and crocodile dominated the auction in terms of bracelet materials, emphasizing the continued preference for traditional and luxurious strap options. 
                While metal and ceramic bracelets also saw notable sales, collectors leaned more toward high-quality leather straps, reflecting the balance between elegance and luxury in the market.

                <strong> Modern watches overwhelmingly dominated the auction, generating over $7 million in total sales.</strong> This suggests a strong preference among collectors for contemporary timepieces, likely due to their widespread availability, advanced technology, and appeal to a broader audience. 
                In contrast, categories like vintage, independent, and neo-vintage contributed smaller portions to the total sales, with vintage watches leading among these.<br><br>

                Independent watches, despite contributing less to total sales, command the highest average prices, exceeding $100,000 per watch. This indicates that independent watchmakers are highly valued for their exclusivity, 
                craftsmanship, and rarity. Collectors are willing to pay a premium for these timepieces, which cater to more niche tastes.<br><br>

                Modern watches, while leading in total sales volume, tend to have more accessible price points. Their popularity likely stems from the fact that they appeal to a wider range of buyers, offering a balance between 
                innovation and affordability, making them attractive to a broader market.<br><br>

                Vintage and neo-vintage watches have comparable average prices, though vintage watches achieved better sales overall. These categories attract collectors interested in historical significance and classic designs, 
                though neo-vintage, which blends modern and vintage elements, remains an emerging area in the luxury watch market.<br><br>

                To conclude, modern watches are preferred in terms of volume, while independent watches hold the highest value among collectors. Vintage and neo-vintage watches continue to appeal to a more specialized group of buyers, 
                highlighting a diverse market that caters to various preferences from modern designs to rare, handcrafted pieces.
