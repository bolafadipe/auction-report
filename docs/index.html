                The auction results reveal a strong performance, with 43.3% of the lots selling within their estimated price range, reflecting accurate pricing strategies by the auction houses. 
                In addition, 40.7% of the lots sold above their estimates, suggesting strong demand and competitive bidding. Only 16% of the lots were sold below their estimate, reflecting a relatively small number of underperforming lots. 
                Importantly, none of the lots went unsold, which signals a very successful auction with high buyer interest.<br><br>

                Phillips outperformed Christie's, accounting for 69% of the total sales with $5.86 million, while Christie's contributed 31%, or $2.64 million. 
                This disparity in sales volume could suggest that Phillips either offered higher-value lots or attracted more competitive bidding. Both auction houses handled a large number of lots but Phillips clearly led in 
                total revenue generated.<br><br>

                Phillips sold 207 lots compared to Christie's 174 lots, further reinforcing its lead in the auction. Despite the difference in lots handled and total sales, both auction houses achieved perfect sell-through rates, 
                showing that every lot found a buyer. This highlights the strong interest in luxury watches from collectors and enthusiasts during the auction.
                The high percentage of lots sold above their estimates suggests that certain items were highly sought after, likely due to their rarity or desirability. 
                This competitive bidding atmosphere was a boon for sellers, as many were able to exceed their price expectations, demonstrating a favorable market environment.<br><br>

                Overall, Phillips dominated the auction in terms of total sales and lots offered, while both auction houses achieved impressive results with all lots sold. 
                A large portion of the lots met or exceeded their price estimates, indicating a robust and competitive luxury watch market that continues to attract buyers.

                The results of the auction reveal the clear dominance of Patek Philippe and Rolex, which together account for a significant portion of total sales. 
                <strong>Patek Philippe led the auction with $2,298,463.9 million in sales</strong>, solidifying its position as the top brand. Rolex followed closely, achieving around $1.5 million. 
                These two brands continue to be the most recognized and sought-after by collectors, reflecting their ongoing influence and desirability in the luxury watch market. <br><br>

                Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe, and Cartier performed well, though at a lower level than the top two, with sales ranging from $0.6 to $1 million. These brands demonstrate strong demand, 
                particularly for iconic models like Audemars Piguet's Royal Oak and F.P. Journe's artisanal offerings, which cater to collectors looking for high craftsmanship and exclusivity. Cartier remains a favorite for its 
                timeless designs and heritage, maintaining steady interest from buyers. <br><br>

                Brands like Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin, Roger Dubuis, and Piaget contributed more modest sales, with totals between $0.2 million and $0.4 million. While these brands are well-regarded, 
                their performance in this auction suggests either fewer pieces on offer or less competitive bidding compared to the leading brands. <br><br>

                Conclusively, the auction results highlight the strength of the luxury watch market, where established and iconic brands like Patek Philippe and Rolex command the highest attention and sales. 
                At the same time, independent and niche brands such as F.P. Journe continue to attract dedicated collectors, indicating a balanced market with opportunities for both mainstream luxury and exclusive timepieces. 
                Buyer preferences remain focused on brands with strong reputations, limited availability, and a history of delivering timeless value.

            </div>
            <p>
                <strong>The 40mm case size emerged as the clear leader in total sales, contributing approximately $2 million.</strong> This size's popularity reflects its broad appeal, offering a perfect balance between classic proportions and modern versatility. 
                Collectors appreciate the 40mm case for its ability to suit various styles, from sport to dress watches, making it a go-to size for both traditional and contemporary designs.<br><br>

                The 42mm case size followed closely, with sales nearing $1 million. This size indicates growing interest in larger, more assertive watches, especially in the luxury sports watch category. 
                Larger cases are often favored for their bold wrist presence and modern aesthetics, appealing to collectors seeking statement pieces that stand out.<br><br>

                Mid-range sizes, including 36mm, 39mm, and 41mm, also performed well, underscoring the continued demand for smaller, more refined watches. These sizes, often associated with vintage or understated designs, 
                appeal to collectors who prioritize elegance and timelessness over boldness. Their strong performance indicates that there is still a significant market for watches that balance tradition and modern functionality.<br><br>

                In summary, the results show that while there is demand across a range of case sizes, the most popular sizes fall within the 40mm to 42mm range, reflecting a strong preference for versatility and bold yet wearable designs. 
                Smaller and larger case sizes saw less activity, suggesting that while they cater to specific tastes, most collectors favor more moderately sized watches. The auction results emphasize that mid-sized watches remain dominant in the luxury market, balancing both modern trends and classic appeal.

            <p>
                Stainless steel stands out as the most popular case material in the auction, generating the highest total sales, just above $2 million. This reflects the strong demand for stainless steel watches, 
                which are favored for their versatility, durability, and more accessible price point compared to precious metals. Stainless steel is widely used in both sports and dress watches, 
                contributing to its broad appeal among collectors.<br><br>

                Following stainless steel, both 18K pink gold and 18K white gold performed well, each contributing significantly to total sales. These materials are prized for their luxury appeal, 
                adding both aesthetic value and exclusivity to the timepieces. Gold, in its various forms, remains a symbol of wealth and prestige, and its continued presence among the top materials reflects the preferences of buyers 
                seeking higher-end luxury watches.<br><br>

                Platinum also made a strong showing in the auction, reflecting its premium status in the luxury market. Known for its rarity, weight, and durability, platinum watches often command higher prices, appealing to collectors 
                looking for the most exclusive timepieces. Other gold variants, such as 18K yellow gold and 18K pink gold with diamonds, also contributed to sales, but on a smaller scale compared to stainless steel and other gold types.<br><br>

                In conclusion, stainless steel led the auction by a significant margin, reflecting its widespread appeal. Gold and platinum also showed strong performance, highlighting the ongoing demand for precious metals in luxury watches. 
                The mix of materials suggests that collectors appreciate both the affordability and versatility of stainless steel, as well as the prestige and exclusivity that comes with gold and platinum watches. Overall, 
                the results indicate a balanced market catering to a range of tastes and budgets.

                   <strong> Leather bracelets generated the highest total sales, reaching over $1.6 million.</strong> This highlights the popularity of leather, a classic material in luxury watches known for its comfort, versatility, and timeless elegance. 
                Leather straps are often paired with both vintage and modern watches, making them a favorite choice among collectors.<br><br>

                Crocodile bracelets followed closely, bringing in significant sales just under $1.4 million. Crocodile leather is highly prized for its exotic and luxurious appearance, appealing to buyers looking for premium materials. 
                Its popularity in high-end watches reflects its association with exclusivity and craftsmanship.<br><br>

                Other materials such as the stainless steel Rolex Oyster bracelet and various gold and ceramic bracelets from brands like Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet contributed more modestly to total sales.

                <strong>Phillips led the September 2024 watch auctions with 207 lots sold</strong>, while Christie's sold 174. 
                Both auction houses achieved a perfect 100% sale rate, with no unsold lots, indicating strong buyer interest and a successful auction event for both.<br><br>

                Phillips had significantly more lots selling within the estimated range, with 104 lots compared to Christie's 61. This suggests that Phillips' pricing estimates were more aligned with market expectations, 
                allowing a larger portion of their lots to meet the pre-sale estimates. Christie's, on the other hand, had fewer lots sold within the estimated range, indicating a greater variability in final sales prices 
                relative to expectations.<br><br>

                When looking at lots sold below the estimate, Christie's had more challenges, with 46 lots selling below the estimate, compared to only 15 for Phillips. This shows that Phillips performed better in 
                maintaining higher selling prices relative to the estimates, while Christie's faced some underperformance on a larger portion of their lots.<br><br>

                Overall, Phillips outperformed Christie's in terms of achieving higher accuracy in pricing and fewer below-estimate sales. Both auction houses enjoyed a high level of demand, as reflected by their perfect sale rates, 
                but Phillips demonstrated stronger control over pricing, leading to more lots sold within or above the estimate.
