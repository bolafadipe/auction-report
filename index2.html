                        <p>Modern watches dominate total sales, accounting for the vast majority of revenue. This indicates a strong preference for contemporary timepieces among auction buyers.

                            <li><strong>Independent Watchmakers Hold the Value:</strong> Despite lower sales volume, independent brands command a much higher average price due to their artisanal quality and rarity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vintage and Neo-Vintage Interest:</strong> These categories show lower total sales and average prices compared to Modern and Independent categories, but they still represent significant segments of the market, indicating continued interest in historical and collectible timepieces.</li>
